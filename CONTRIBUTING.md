## Commit Guidelines

Be sure your commit messages follow this specification: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/

## Add yourself as a contributor

This project follows the [all contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors)
specification. To add yourself to the table of contributors on the `README.md`, please use the
automated script as part of your PR:

```console
yarn contributors:add
```

Follow the prompt and commit `.all-contributorsrc` and `README.md` in the PR. If you've already
added yourself to the list and are making a new type of contribution, you can run it again and
select the added contribution type.

## Committing and Pushing changes

Please make sure to run the tests before you commit your changes. You can do so by running
`npm test three`.

## Creating a PR

We have two core branches that mirror the `three` repo. If your PR is for the current release of `three` it should be based off `master` and aimed at merging back into `master`. If you're PR is for the next release of `three` then it should be based off `dev` and therefore aimed at merging back into `dev`.

## Help needed
