/**
 * Holds the voxel representation of a scene for {@link VXGINode}: an anisotropic opacity
 * mip chain, a direct radiance volume and a radiance volume with cached bounces.
 *
 * The representation is a dense variant of the pre-filtered voxel hierarchy of Crassin et al. 2011
 * (a dense mip chain instead of a sparse octree, which keeps cone samples to two texture fetches):
 * opacity stores visibility per major axis and is filtered directionally (volumetric integration
 * along the axis, averaging across it), radiance is stored opacity-premultiplied and indirect bounces
 * are cached in the volume via cone tracing. Only direct lights are injected.
 * Voxelization uses conservative rasterization along the dominant triangle axis in a compute shader.
 *
 * Direct light is injected per voxel instead of splatting photons from a light-view map as in the
 * paper: the shadow maps rendered by the renderer are the light-view maps, and every occupied voxel
 * pulls its visibility from them (2D maps for directional and spot lights, cube maps for point
 * lights) and evaluates its irradiance analytically. This reuses the existing shadow passes, makes
 * the injected shadows match the direct lighting exactly and needs neither atomics nor a
 * normalization by photon density. Lights without a shadow map fall back to a visibility cone
 * traced through the volume. The trade-off is a cost proportional to the number of occupied voxels
 * times lights rather than to the light-view resolution, and that only outgoing diffuse radiance
 * is stored (no incoming direction distribution for glossy cones).
