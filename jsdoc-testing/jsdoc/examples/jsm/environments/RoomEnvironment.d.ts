/**
 * This class represents a scene with a basic room setup that can be used as
 * input for {@link PMREMGenerator#fromScene}. The resulting PMREM represents the room's
 * lighting and can be used for Image Based Lighting by assigning it to {@link Scene#environment}
 * or directly as an environment map to PBR materials.
 *
 * The implementation is based on the [EnvironmentScene](https://github.com/google/model-viewer/blob/master/packages/model-viewer/src/three-components/EnvironmentScene.ts)
 * component from the `model-viewer` project.
 *
 * ```js
 * const environment = new RoomEnvironment();
 * const pmremGenerator = new THREE.PMREMGenerator( renderer );
 *
 * const envMap = pmremGenerator.fromScene( environment ).texture;
 * scene.environment = envMap;
 * ```
 *
 * @augments Scene
 * @three_import import { RoomEnvironment } from 'three/addons/environments/RoomEnvironment.js';
