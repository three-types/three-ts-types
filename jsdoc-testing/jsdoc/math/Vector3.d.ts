/**
 * Class representing a 3D vector. A 3D vector is an ordered triplet of numbers
 * (labeled x, y and z), which can be used to represent a number of things, such as:
 *
 * - A point in 3D space.
 * - A direction and length in 3D space. In three.js the length will
 * always be the Euclidean distance(straight-line distance) from `(0, 0, 0)` to `(x, y, z)`
 * and the direction is also measured from `(0, 0, 0)` towards `(x, y, z)`.
 * - Any arbitrary ordered triplet of numbers.
 *
 * There are other things a 3D vector can be used to represent, such as
 * momentum vectors and so on, however these are the most
 * common uses in three.js.
 *
 * Iterating through a vector instance will yield its components `(x, y, z)` in
 * the corresponding order.
 * ```js
 * const a = new THREE.Vector3( 0, 1, 0 );
 *
 * //no arguments; will be initialised to (0, 0, 0)
 * const b = new THREE.Vector3( );
 *
 * const d = a.distanceTo( b );
 * ```
